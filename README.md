## üëã About Me

Hi! I'm **Fausto**, a **Media Designer** and **Creative Developer** with a passion for interaction design and video games.  
I enjoy building visual experiences that combine design, code, and interactivity ‚Äî from experimental websites to playful digital environments.  
My work often explores the intersection of aesthetics and function, using both traditional and emerging technologies.

## üå± Concept & Goals

The main goal of this portfolio was to create a **simple**, **clean**, and **visually balanced** interface that communicates effectively without unnecessary complexity.

### Design Approach

- **Simplicity First**  
  I began by researching minimalist layouts to focus on essential content and usability. The goal was to avoid visual noise and guide the user naturally through the page.

- **Color Palette**  
  The colors were chosen to support readability and mood. I tested different combinations to find a that felt personal but professional, ensuring enough contrast and harmony.

- **Typography & Composition**  
  Attention was paid to spacing, font hierarchy, and layout rhythm to create a balanced and aesthetically pleasing composition.

## ü§ñ Tech Stack

This portfolio was built using:

- **HTML** ‚Äî for structure  
- **CSS** ‚Äî for layout, color, and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** ‚Äî for interactive elements such as Geometry Dash tribute, //toggles// and transitions
- **Zephyr** ‚Äî used for photogrammetric reconstruction of 3D models shown in the viewer
- **Reality Capture** ‚Äî used for photogrammetric reconstruction of 3D models shown in the viewer

## üîç 3D Model Viewer

A key interactive feature of this portfolio is a **3D viewer** that allows users to explore models reconstructed using **photogrammetry**.

- Models were created using **3DF Zephyr**, and **Reality Capture** photogrammetry tools that convert photos into high-quality 3D meshes.
- These models are exported in `.glb` format and rendered in the browser using **Three.js**.
- The viewer includes:
  - Orbit controls (zoom, rotate, pan)
  - Responsive canvas that adapts to screen size
  - Optimized loading for lightweight performance

## üì± Features

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop  
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations  
- Clear navigation with intuitive user flow  
- Modular and readable code structure
- Integrated 3D content to highlight digital craftsmanship

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Add light mode support  
- Integrate project filters or categories
- Add loading indicators and model info overlays in the 3D viewer
- Improve the tablet layout and responsiveness.
- English translation
- Buying a domain .com .design etc.
