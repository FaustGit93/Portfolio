# Portfolio - Fausto Rabatti

Welcome to my personal page! This repository showcases my projects developed between 2021 and the 2025 as a Media Designer. 
My approach is to develop focusing on clarity, minimalism, and user experience.

## ðŸ¤” Concept & Goals

The main goal of this portfolio was to create a **simple**, **clean**, and **visually balanced** interface that communicates effectively without unnecessary complexity.

### Design Approach

- **Simplicity First**  
  I began by researching minimalist layouts to focus on essential content and usability. The goal was to avoid visual noise and guide the user naturally through the page.

- **Color Palette**  
  The colors were chosen to support readability and mood. I tested different combinations to find a that felt personal but professional, ensuring enough contrast and harmony.

- **Typography & Composition**  
  Attention was paid to spacing, font hierarchy, and layout rhythm to create a balanced and aesthetically pleasing composition.

## ðŸ¤– Tech Stack

This portfolio was built using:

- **HTML** â€” for structure  
- **CSS** â€” for layout, color, and responsiveness  
- **JavaScript** â€” for interactive elements such as Geometry Dash tribute, //toggles// and transitions
- **Zephyr** â€” used for photogrammetric reconstruction of 3D models shown in the viewer
- **Reality Capture** â€” used for photogrammetric reconstruction of 3D models shown in the viewer

## ðŸ”¨ 3D Model Viewer

A key interactive feature of this portfolio is a **3D viewer** that allows users to explore models reconstructed using **photogrammetry**.

- Models were created using **3DF Zephyr**, and **Reality Capture** photogrammetry tools that convert photos into high-quality 3D meshes.
- These models are exported in `.glb` format and rendered in the browser using **Three.js**.
- The viewer includes:
  - Orbit controls (zoom, rotate, pan)
  - Responsive canvas that adapts to screen size
  - Optimized loading for lightweight performance

## ðŸš€ Features

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop  
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations  
- Clear navigation with intuitive user flow  
- Modular and readable code structure
- Integrated 3D content to highlight digital craftsmanship

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

- Add light mode support  
- Integrate project filters or categories
- Add loading indicators and model info overlays in the 3D viewer
- Improve the tablet layout and responsiveness.
