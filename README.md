# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills in web design and front-end development. It was built with a focus on clarity, minimalism, and user experience.

## 🌱 Concept & Goals

The main goal of this portfolio was to create a **simple**, **clean**, and **visually balanced** interface that communicates effectively without unnecessary complexity.

### Design Approach

- **Simplicity First**  
  I began by researching minimalist layouts to focus on essential content and usability. The goal was to avoid visual noise and guide the user naturally through the work.

- **Color Palette**  
  The colors were chosen to support readability and mood. I tested different combinations to find a palette that felt personal but professional, ensuring enough contrast and harmony.

- **Typography & Composition**  
  Attention was paid to spacing, font hierarchy, and layout rhythm to create a balanced and aesthetically pleasing composition.
